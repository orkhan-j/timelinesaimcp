# üöÄ Timelines AI MCP Client Setup Guide

Welcome to the Timelines AI MCP (Model Context Protocol) services! This guide will help you connect to our PostHog and Google Ads MCP servers from your Claude Desktop app.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Claude Desktop** app installed on your computer
- **Node.js** installed (version 18 or higher)
- **Git** installed on your system

## üéØ Available MCP Services

We provide two MCP services:
1. **PostHog MCP** - Analytics and product metrics
2. **Google Ads MCP** - Campaign management and reporting

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/orkhan-j/timelinesaimcp.git
cd timelinesaimcp
```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posthog": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/timelinesaimcp/posthog-local-proxy.js"]
    },
    "googleads": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/timelinesaimcp/googleads-local-proxy.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Replace `/path/to/timelinesaimcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repository.

Example for Mac users:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posthog": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/Projects/timelinesaimcp/posthog-local-proxy.js"]
    },
    "googleads": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/Projects/timelinesaimcp/googleads-local-proxy.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (completely quit and reopen)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Look for the üîå icon in the text input area

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP servers not showing in Claude

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Claude Desktop is completely closed (check system tray)
2. Verify your config file path is correct
3. Check that the proxy files exist in your cloned repository
4. Restart Claude Desktop

### Issue: "Connection refused" errors

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the server is accessible: `curl https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/health`
3. Try running the proxy directly to see errors:
   ```bash
   node /path/to/timelinesaimcp/posthog-local-proxy.js
   ```

### Issue: "Command not found: node"

**Solution:**
Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (version 18 or higher)

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Solution:**
The servers use pre-configured API keys. If you're getting auth errors, contact the Timelines AI team.

## üîê Security Notes
