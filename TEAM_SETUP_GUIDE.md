# ðŸš€ MCP Services - Team Setup Guide (Super Simple!)

## What You Need to Know
Our MCP service helps you analyze PostHog data. Think of it as a smart assistant that can fetch and analyze your product analytics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Setup (5 minutes!)

### Step 1: Install the MCP Client
Open your Terminal app and paste this command:
```bash
npx --yes mcp-remote@latest https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/sse
```
That's it! The service will start running.

### Step 2: What You Can Do
Once connected, you can ask questions like:
- "Show me today's user activity"
- "What are the top events this week?"
- "Get me the feature flags status"
- "Show me user engagement metrics"

## ðŸ”§ If Something Goes Wrong

### "Connection Failed" Error
Try this command instead:
```bash
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/sse
```
If you see data flowing, the service is working!

### "Command Not Found" Error
You need to install Node.js first:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Click the big green "Download" button
3. Install it like any other app
4. Try Step 1 again

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Non-Developers
