# üîß Troubleshooting "Could not authenticate request" Error

## ‚úÖ Server Status: Working!
The MCP server at `mcp.timelinesaitech.com` is running and Google Ads authentication is valid.

If you're seeing "Could not authenticate request" error, the issue is with your **local setup**, not the server.

## üéØ Quick Fixes (Try These First)

   - Or: Alt+F4 when Claude is focused
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Start Claude Desktop again**
4. **Try the command again**

### Fix 2: Verify File Paths in Config

1. Open File Explorer
2. Paste in address bar: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
3. Open `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. **Check your config looks like this:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-ads": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourWindowsUsername\\Downloads\\Timelines MCP\\googleads-local-proxy.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Common Mistakes:**

- ‚ùå Wrong username
- ‚ùå Wrong file location

### Fix 3: Test the Script Manually

Open Command Prompt and run:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\YourWindowsUsername\Downloads\Timelines MCP"
node googleads-local-proxy.js
```

**What you should see:**
```
Connecting to remote MCP server...
Connected to MCP gateway
```

**If you see an error:**
- "Cannot find module" ‚Üí Run `npm install` first
- "node is not recognized" ‚Üí Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
- "ECONNREFUSED" ‚Üí Check your internet connection

### Fix 4: Re-download the Files

Sometimes files get corrupted. Re-download:

1. Go to: https://github.com/orkhan-j/timelinesaimcp
2. Click green "Code" button ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
3. Extract to `C:\Users\YourWindowsUsername\Downloads\Timelines MCP`
4. Open Command Prompt in that folder:
   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```
5. Update your Claude Desktop config with the correct path
6. Restart Claude Desktop

## üîç Detailed Diagnostics

### Check 1: Is Node.js Installed?

```cmd
node --version
npm --version
```

Should show version numbers. If not, install from https://nodejs.org

### Check 2: Are Dependencies Installed?

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\YourWindowsUsername\Downloads\Timelines MCP"
dir node_modules
```

Should show a `node_modules` folder. If not:
```cmd
npm install
```

### Check 3: Can You Reach the Server?

```cmd
curl https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/health
```

Should show: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

If not:
- Check your internet connection
- Check if company firewall is blocking it
- Try connecting to VPN if required

### Check 4: Test PostHog (Simpler Test)

Try PostHog instead to see if it's a Google Ads-specific issue:

Add to your config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posthog": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourWindowsUsername\\Downloads\\Timelines MCP\\posthog-local-proxy.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and try: "Show me PostHog dashboards"

If PostHog works but Google Ads doesn't, contact your team lead.

3. **Wrong config syntax** - Single vs double backslashes
4. **Missing npm install** - Dependencies not installed
5. **Antivirus blocking** - Windows Defender blocking Node.js

## ‚úÖ Success Looks Like This

When working correctly, you'll see:
1. üîå icon in Claude Desktop text input
2. "google-ads" listed when you click it
3. Commands work: "List my Google Ads campaigns"
4. You see campaign data, not authentication errors
