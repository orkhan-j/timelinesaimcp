## ‚ùå Common Windows Issues & Fixes

### "npx is not recognized as a command"
This means Node.js isn't installed:
1. Go back to Step 1
2. Install Node.js
3. **Important**: Close Command Prompt
4. Open a new Command Prompt
5. Try the command again

### "Access Denied" or Permission Errors
1. Close Command Prompt
2. Right-click on Command Prompt
3. Choose **"Run as administrator"**
4. Try the command again

### Windows Defender or Antivirus Warning
- This is normal for command-line tools
- Click **"Allow"** or **"Run anyway"**
- The tool is safe (it's from our company server)

### "Cannot connect" Error
Check if you're behind a company firewall:
1. Connect to company VPN if required
2. Try again
3. If still failing, contact IT to allow: `mcp.timelinesaitech.com`

## üí° Windows PowerShell (Alternative)

If Command Prompt doesn't work, try PowerShell:
1. Click Start button
2. Type: `powershell`
3. Press Enter
4. Run the same command:
```powershell
npx --yes mcp-remote@latest https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/sse
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PowerShell "Scripts Disabled" Error

If you see this error in PowerShell:
```
npx : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

**Quick Fix - Use Command Prompt Instead:**
1. Close PowerShell
2. Open Command Prompt (type `cmd` in Start menu)
3. Run the same npx command there

**Alternative Fix - Enable Scripts in PowerShell:**
1. Close PowerShell
2. Right-click Start button
3. Choose **"Windows PowerShell (Admin)"** or **"Terminal (Admin)"**
4. Type this command and press Enter:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
5. When asked "Do you want to change the execution policy?", type `Y` and press Enter
6. Close the admin PowerShell
7. Open regular PowerShell
8. Try the npx command again

**One-Time Bypass (No Admin Needed):**
If you can't get admin rights, use this command in regular PowerShell:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npx --yes mcp-remote@latest https://mcp.timelinesaitech.com/sse"
```
